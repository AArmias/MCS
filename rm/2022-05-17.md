Lets try to start the server with the following command:
```
sudo java -Xms1024M -Xmx1024M -jar /srv/salt/MCS/server.jar --nogui
```
Java options should be added between the `java` and the `-jar`.
`-Xms` (the initial memory size).
`-Xmx` sets how much memory the server is allowed to use.
`/srv/salt/MCS/server.jar` is the server location and file.
`--nogui` Doesn't open the GUI when launching the server.
You can also set other parameters at the start command, more instructions can be found at this link:
