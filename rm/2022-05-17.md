Lets try to start the server with the following command:
```
sudo java -Xms1024M -Xmx1024M -jar /srv/salt/MCS/server.jar --nogui
```
Java options should be added between the `java` and the `-jar`.
`-Xms` (the initial memory size).
`-Xmx` sets how much memory the server is allowed to use.
`/srv/salt/MCS/server.jar` is the server location and file.
`--nogui` Doesn't open the GUI when launching the server.
You can also set other parameters at the start command, more instructions can be found at this link:

### Starting server with byobu

Command `byobu` will start byobu shell and `F6` close, but applications running in the byobu shell remain on in the background. `F12` will close shell and the applications. So when you start byobun and the server there you can switch from the F6 button back to the normal shell and the server will run in the background. You can return by typing byobu again. The byobun shell is different enough to distinguish it from a normal shell.

and when you press `F6` it shows it like this:
